###INSTALL###
see information/INSTALL/README

###QUICK START GUIDE###

1)Connecting directly to MySQL database
database name:microbedb

"mysql -u perlapi -p"

2)Using MicrobeDB Perl API
At the start of your perl script you need:
use lib '/your/path/to/MicrobeDB';
use MicrobeDB::Search;

See example in "information/example_scripts";

###Overview of MicrobeDB###
*Note: Information below is available as a Powerpoint presentation in "information/Basic_Overview_MicrobeDB.ppt"

MicrobeDB
Centralized storage and access to completed Archaea and Bacteria genomes
Same as those available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi

Genome/Flat files are stored in one central location

Information at the genome project, chromosome, and gene level are parsed and stored in a MySQL database 
including sequences and annotations 

The files and the database are updated monthly

MySQL

Version
Each monthly download from NCBI is given a new version number
Advantages
Data will not change if you always use the same version number of microbedb
Version date can be cited for any method publications
Disadvantages
Data is redundant in the database (e.g. multiple versions of the same gene)
A version number (version_id) must always be used when retrieving information otherwise multiple copies will be returned 

Genomeproject
Contains information about the genome project and the organism that was sequenced
E.g. taxon_id, org_name, lineage, gram_stain, genome_gc, patho_status, disease, genome_size, pathogenic_in, temp_range, habitat, shape, arrangement, endospore, motility, salinity, etc.
Each genomeproject contains one or more replicons

Replicon
Chromosome or plasmids
E.g. rep_accnum, definition, rep_type, rep_ginum, cds_num, gene_num, protein_num, genome_id, rep_size, rna_num, rep_seq (complete nucleotide sequence)
Each replicon contains one or more genes

Gene
Contains gene annotations and also the DNA and protein sequences (if protein coding gene)
E.g. gid, pid, protein_accnum, gene_type, gene_start, gene_end, gene_length, gene_strand, gene_name, locus_tag, gene_product, gene_seq, protein_seq
