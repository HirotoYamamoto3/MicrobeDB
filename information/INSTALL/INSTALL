These are the basic guidelines to getting MicrobeDB set up locally on your machine

Optional Initial Step: Create a user to access the database:
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE USER microbedb IDENTIFITED BY 'some_password'";
mysql -u root -p -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON microbedb.* to 'microbedb'@'localhost'";


Step 1: Create the microbedb database (Note: can use different database name instead of 'microbedb')
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE microbedb"

Step 2: Load the microbedb table structures
mysql -u root -p microbedb < microbedb_schema.sql

Step 3: Create or confirm your MySQL login config file ~/.my.cnf
emacs $HOME/.my.cnf
  [client]
  host=localhost
  user=microbedb (or whatever username you use)
  password=some_password

  [mysql]
  database=microbedb (or whatever database name you created above)

Step 4: Protect your MySQL config file
chmod 600 $HOME/.my.cnf

Step 5: Add MicrobeDB to your perl PATH. You can do this by putting the MicrobeDB folder in the same location as other perl modules or by adding the path to MicrobeDB to your $PERL5LIB environment variable

Step 6: Get the genome files from genbank via ftp/ASPERA and parse files into mysql (this can take awhile time)
./scripts/download_load_and_delete_old_version.pl -d <directory_for_flat_file_storage>

Note: *If the download completes but there are errors in the parsing stage, then "run_update.pl <download_dir>" can be used to just redo the parsing part.

Step 7: (optional) Load your personal genomes:
./scripts/load_custom_genomes.pl -d <your_directory>
